## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** for clear and accessible markup
- **CSS Custom Properties** for reusable and maintainable styles
- **Flexbox** for efficient layout structuring

### What I Learned

One key takeaway from this project was how to incorporate multiple background images in CSS while maintaining proper positioning and responsiveness. Below is an example of how I used `background-image`, `background-position`, and `background-size` to achieve the design:

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-image: url(./assets/images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./assets/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: -300px -500px, 160% -220%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-size: 70%, 70%;
  background-color: #19a1ae;
}
```

This approach helped me control the positioning of the background elements dynamically.
